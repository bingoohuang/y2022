[YACC program to implement a Calculator and recognize a valid Arithmetic expression](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/yacc-program-to-implement-a-calculator-and-recognize-a-valid-arithmetic-expression/)

Yacc (for “yet another compiler compiler.”) is the standard parser generator for the Unix operating system. An open source program, yacc generates code for the parser in the C programming language. The acronym is usually rendered in lowercase but is occasionally seen as YACC or Yacc.

YACC (yet another compiler-compiler) is an LALR(1) (LookAhead, Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation producer with 1 lookahead token) parser generator. YACC was originally designed for being complemented by Lex.
